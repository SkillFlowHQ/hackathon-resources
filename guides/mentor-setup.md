# Getting Started with SkillFlow (Mentors)

## Initial Setup

**First, send “Hello” to SkillFlow**

**You may choose to go through the demo, but it’s not necessary nor required, so just hit “No Thanks”**

**Now just tell SkillFlow some languages/frameworks that you know.**

## Answering Questions

**If a hacker posts a question that SkillFlow determines you’re likely to be able to answer, you’ll receive a notification like this:**

**If you accept the question, you will be thrown into a real-time chat with the hacker that needs help.**

**You may either answer the question in the chat, or meet with the hacker in person (they may specify where they are over the chat).**

It’s generally best practice to clarify the question beforehand in case the problem is something the hacker may be able to solve themselves or another mentor may be more suited to assist the hacker.

**When you’re done assisting the hacker, you can end the session using** `/skillflow end` .
**You will be prompted to rate your experience with the hacker (This is data that will be sent to the hackathon and used by SkillFlow to help make future experiences better).**

**If someone is trolling and/or being disrespectful to others, please do not hesitate to report them to SkillFlow.**
