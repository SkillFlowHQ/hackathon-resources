# SkillFlow for Hackathons

## What is SkillFlow?
SkillFlow is an easy-to-use, real-time mentor queuing service for hackathons that plugs directly into your slack. Relevant, available mentors are directly pinged instead of having them find the question.

## Setup
There's almost no setup for you. SkillFlow plugs into Slack and is ready to go.
