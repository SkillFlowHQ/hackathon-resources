**You may choose to go through the demo, but it’s not necessary nor required, so just hit “No Thanks”**

## Asking Questions

**If you would like to ask a question to be answered by a mentor, just direct message SkillFlow your question (this is an example):**

**If the question has been answered before, you will receive an automatic answer.**

**You can further ask for clarification, in which case your question will be posted for a mentor to answer.**

It’s a good idea to have your question be as specific as possible, as a mentor will see this question before choosing whether to answer. The more specific your question, the more likely that the mentor answering will be able to answer your question.

**When you’re finished, you can end the session using** `/skillflow end` .
**You will be prompted to rate your experience with the mentor (This is data that will be sent to the hackathon and used by SkillFlow to help make future experiences better).**
